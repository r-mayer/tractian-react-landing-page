# TRACTIAN Landing Page using React

In this project I will be developing a landing page for TRACTIAN as a challenge for the Web Developer selection process.

I'm doing my own UI design using Figma and then I'll be coding.

## Design

In the beginning, I designed the Hero section using Figma. The idea was to create something like a Dark Theme, but keeping the brand's visual identity. 

I scraped some images from the current site, and made changes to some vectors.

In Figma, I just sketched out a few sections, like the Header and Hero. The other components I designed while coding the CSS, without using the Figma project.

The print below shows the sketch I made.

## CSS

In this case, I chose to use pure CSS, without libraries or anything like that. All styles were made with CSS only. My idea is, in the future, to refactor the code using Styled Components.


## Responsiveness

I tried to make the site as responsive as possible. All components adjust to the screen size, including some menus, as seen below:
